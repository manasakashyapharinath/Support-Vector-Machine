Support Vector Machine with Linear, Polynomial and Gaussian Kernels

Note: The write up is provided in the Support Vector Manchine.ipynb and SM_using_trival_data.ipynb which contains step by step explanation.

Dataset:

For our implementation we have used IRIS dataset from the sklearn library. There are 4 predictor attributes and one response attribute. We have considered only 2 predictor attributes. Sepal_length and sepal_width and try to predict which class of plant it belongs to, Setosa (0) or Versicolour(1).
We have uploaded 2 files: Support Vector Manchine.ipynb and SM_using_trival_data.ipynb

Sklearn Implementation on IRIS Dataset:

Support Vector Manchine.ipynb: Contains the implementation using sklearn library using Linear, Polynomial and Gaussian kernels. The respective performance measures are also recorded along with their best hyperparameter values. We obtained the best score value of 0.838 for polynomial kernel.

Sklearn implementation on Trivial Dataset:

SM_using_trival_data.ipynb: Contains implementation using sklearn library on a randomly generated dataset having two input predictors and one output response value. Their respective performance measures are recorded along with the best hyperparameter values. The results are also plotted to show the actual classification of the new data. We obtained the best score value of 0.9699 for polynomial kernel.
